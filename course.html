		<h1>The Course Retrospoective Project</h1>
		<p>WRA 110 Science and technology (hybrid) is a unique and interesting class for first year college students. During this semester this class has improved and developed my writing skills in many different ways. I have written many different papers throughout the semester, which covered different aspects which improved many of my skills, such as writing skills, research skills, creativity, and interviewing skills.  These skills are really critical during college and beyond during my professional life. This course had five major projects. Each project focused on a particular aspect. These five projects where The Lived Experience, The Cultural Analysis, The formal Research, The Multimedia Remix and finally The Course Retrospective Project. As I mentioned this course is unique. Throughout the semester the class was leaning how to code using HTML. We learned to use HTML because we had to submit every paper as a document and place it on our personal portfolios. So we had to learn how to edit and design our own portfolio.  </p>
		<p>This course topic is all about the digital age so all of the assignments are related to the topic one way or another. Assignment one the lived experience project, I had to pick a piece of technology that has impacted me during my life and made me choose to become and engineer. For me I grow up in a family of engineers. Since I was young I have been fascinated by computers and how they work. Personally I wreaked around five electronically devices in my home trying to see what's inside of them. While growing up I was certain I will become an electrical engineer, but in my last years in high school I started helping my father at work where I experienced the business and management side of an engineering. When I got accepted at Michigan State I heard about applied engineering which is a combination of business and engineering. The point of this assignment was to learn how to write a narrative paper but it also helped me reflect on my past and the reasons I chose to become and engineer and to learn more about the two majors that I am considering.    </p>
		<p>The second Paper was the cultural analysis. In the cultural analysis we had to analysis a cultural artifact to investigate an issue our societies are facing. Before starting to think about the artifact, we watched a South Park episode during class, about people that are addicted to online games. Watching that episode gave me a lot of idea to write in my paper. I finally decided to write about how violent video games like Call of Duty have made their players behavior more violent and aggressive. One of the main reasons that made me pick this artifact is its effect on my own society. While writing this paper I considered my audiences were the players themselves and their parents. Like every paper I wrote in the class I had to peer review my paper with my classmates. The point of peer reviewing is to help one another by giving good feedback on each other's papers and the things they should focus on. Peer reviewing personally helped me improve my papers and I recommend giving good feedback to other to get good feedbacks. All in all this paper helped improve my reading and comprehensions skills, also I was able to learn how to analysis information in a better way and use it to benefit my report.   </p>
		<p>Project three the formal research. In my opinion this was the hardest and longest but the most important between all the other papers, because research papers are essential in my major and it's an important skill to have as an engineer. The point of this project was to improve and develop my skill as a researcher. The topic of the project was explaining my major and the things that are happening in like new inventions, but also what kinds of communications are being used in it and how useful and important are these communication skills and methods. A usual I started my search on google but it never provided me with what I really need. So I changed my methods and started using ProQuest and the MSU library. These two sources helped me gather most of the information that I needed for my research.  Another important skill that I improved during this research is my interviewing skills by conducting a couple of interviews with faculties that are related to my major. It was hard at the beginning but with time and practice you will get used to it. At the end of the project I was able to write a paper to explain most if not all parts of my major, but one thing that you must be aware of during and report is plagiarism. It really important to take care while writing such papers because it's so easy to fall into it.   </p>
		<p>The forth and most interesting and enjoyable assignment the multimedia remix. During this assignment we had to work in groups to remix one of our previous assignments into a documentary. This assignment shows that not all assignments and projects that a person would present will be on paper. Now a day's people have to be more creative when presenting and this assignment was the best way to be creative. Working in teams in college isn’t easy. Your teammates might be busy. Conflicts between team members might accrue, but you must communicate with one another to finish the project. One thing my team did to communicate is to use group chats and google docs to make it easier to communicate. During this assignment we also learned how to write a proposal for our assignments and also a team evaluation paper to evaluate your teammates so everyone gets the grade he/ she deserves. As a personal advice the best way to succeed in a group project is by managing your time well.</p>
		<p>Last but not least is the course retrospective project. During this last project you will be writing a paper like the one you are reading now. The point is to reflect what you learned during the semester like conducting research and interviews in assignment three or being creative in the multimedia remix. This last assignment helped me to reevaluate myself and see how I have improved in many different aspects that will help me during college and after in my professional life, but this is not all. In this project there is another part. In the second part the class as a whole will work together to form a website to place all the papers that we wrote during the semester to help future coming students to this course, understand what to expect when picking a class like WRA 110 and giving them advise and tips to succeed in the class.</p>
		<p>This class is a hybrid and the interesting this about it is that we have a second part to the class rather than the five assignments, which is creating a portfolio that holds our own individual assignments. While we have been writing our papers we also have been learning how to use HTML coding which is a type of coding program that creates websites. We learned how to use HTML from a website called code academy. In code academy I learned the basics for coding and for styling a website. All of this helped me create the code for the second part of the final assignment the course retrospective project.  </p>
		<p>All in all WRA 110 science and technology is a unique and special class and with each assignment you improve an important aspect that will benefit you in the future. The lived experience made me think back on the reasons I choose my major and narrate it to the reader. The cultural analysis helped me learn and analysis things that I didn't know and was able to write a paper to send a message to the community. The formal research it was tough my made me a better researcher and interviewer and that’s a major bones for me in the future. The multimedia Remix project working in a team to make something on paper come alive. That’s how I became more creative in writing. Finally the course retrospective project where I reflected back to all the things that I have done so far in this course and to see the improvement that I have made in writing, analysis, research, and creativity. All in all the class developed many of my skills in many different ways that will help me during college and after. </p>
