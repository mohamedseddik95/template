			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>A research in 2000 showed that 90% of the parents for teens from 8th till 12th grade never check the rating of the games their children by and 89% of parents don't limit the time their kids play these games. That causes the child to get addicted to the game which develops with time to become the issue that we are facing now, which is the aggressive behavior of children. I think parents should be aware of these consequences and somehow be orientated within their small communities. This could be the start of solving this issue.</p>
			<p>Also I think an issue like this which can escalade to mass killing all around the world couldn't be changed by the efforts with the communities alone. Government around the world should spread awareness of this problem within the schools and the use of public media. Also the government should confront these companies like Infinity Ward and convince them to change their games to make them less violent. These companies should also be held responsible to the effects they cause on the young if they commit crimes like the mass killings.</p>
			<p>Another way we should also follow is to limit the players by making the age restrictions higher so that when player are exposed to the game they are grown up and know right from wrong like alcohol. You're not allowed to drink until your twenty one in the United State because when people drink when they are younger they cause more problems.  </p>
