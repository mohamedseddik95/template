			<h1>Discussion</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this report is to present a better understanding of electrical engineering. The results have shown that practical work isn’t the only or mainly thing electrical engineers do. They also focus of the communication part of their field. I, as a future engineer never expected that around 50% of my time will be spent communicating all its methods (oral, writing, visual, etc...). Since I Started studying at Michigan State University one of the major classes I took was introducing to engineering design. This class is meant to improve all of an engineer's communication and design skills.</p>
			<p>I was also expecting that electrical engineers only read research work related to electrical engineering. However, I didn’t know about the annual conferences and journals, where engineers meet to share one another works and to gain experiences by sharing their findings. I think it is a really good idea because the more I learn about engineering the more I realize that the departments tend to overlap one another and work together to solve problems. </p>
			<p>The result that research plays a major role in all engineering major was expected. I knew that without research nothing can be found nor invented I engineering. The quote by Dr. Boker that "there would be no science called “electrical engineering” if there was no research." Sums that whole importance of research within electrical engineering and all the other disciplines.</p>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>All in all, electrical engineering in a wide and interesting disciplines. There are many opportunities in this discipline. From the results we found that electrical engineering is not only laboratory and experimental work. The communication side of the discipline is very important and vital, that is why universities try to focuses on team design programs from the beginning of an engineer's academic year to enhance his communication and research skill to allow him to improve and prosper in his professional career.  To achieve all these goals colleges try to equip their labs and classes with the highest and newest technology for the benefit of their future engineers. These are the main things expected an electrical engineer will face during in academic life in college.</p>
