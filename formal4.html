			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Based on the data and research that I collected, electrical engineering isn’t only practical work in labs. Communication skills are very important and crucial within all engineering disciplines. The amounts of time engineers spend on practical work in labs. They are expected to spend the same amount communicating through many different skills. </p>
			<p>In our current age most companies tend to go global. That means more cross culture communication. To communicate you need a common language. English for it's widely spread language, which is why most companies worldwide require there, employs to have good communication skills in English. Although English is an international language many think that foreign languages skills are increasing important to communicate with the culture region where English isn’t there main language. (Riemer)</p>
			<p>Another important skill engineer's use frequently in field of work is writing. Writing is very important and cortical. If an engineer has poor and ineffective writing skills the result of his papers may be misunderstood and causes waste of time, money and may even endanger others using your device. (Joel)</p>
			<p> Engineers use different types of writing. They use in reports, technical writing, reflective journals, peer reviews, and mock and student conference papers. Each type has its own type and methods to write. (Riemer). During the interview with Dr.Boker, he mentioned that his work involves a lot of research, and the main type of communication that he uses is scientific papers. These papers should be concise and accurate because they are published in certain conferences and journals. To make sure that his paper are always accurate they are always review by multiple referees. (Boker).</p>
			<p>Additional to writing skills, oral communication is one of the important skills used. Oral communication such as presentations and speeches in conferences are considered 	one of the biggest enhancers and a biggest factor in determining the success or failure of a student career, because now a days employers aren’t just looking for high grades, they are looking for students that stand out with their personal skills and one of the main things in oral communications. Practical methods had the most results to improve oral skills. Examples like presenting, peer review, and role play. (Riemer)</p>
			<p>Communicating with others isn’t just sending information, receiving information is very important. 45% of the time communicating should be spent listening to what other has to say. Visual communication skills for instance graphs, diagrams, and pictures are also significant when communicating with others. Every engineering discipline uses visual communications frequently for means of non-verbal communication. This skill is very important because it tends to be understood much faster that written communication, plus it can be understood easier when communicating with different cultures. (Riemer) A point Alstawy pointed out that when presenting your work visual images like graphs charts pictures and much more powerful than words, because they contain more meaning and effect than words. They also help close the gap between cross cultural communication and the bounder of language. (Alshtawy)</p>

			<p>As I previously mentioned that we are in an age of globalization.  And with the new technology that allows us to communicate globally in an increasing speeds and with less costs, because we don’t have to travel and migrate. Intercultural skills are essential because to understand how people work and their methods, you must learn about their culture. (riemer)  </p>
			<p>Many American universities noticed the important of hands on design projects that help improve students build design, teamwork, and communication skills. This is class is called introduction to engineering design at Michigan State University. The point of the class is to improve freshmen engineer's skills in many areas. One of the areas they concentrate on is communication. Allowing students to work in small group to complete certain tasks and projects, it enhances their skills as a team and there ability to communicate with people they never meets before. The class also tends to have a big concentration on the technical writing style in engineering considering it to be the most used, also improving oral skills by posters and presentations.
