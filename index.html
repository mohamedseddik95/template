			<p>My name is Mohamed Seddik. I'm an international student from Benghazi, Libya. Libya is located in North Africa on the Mediterranean sea. The weather there is much better than Michigan. </p>
		
			
			
			<p>I am the youngest of four siblings which are all engineers like me. My major is Applied Engineering Science. I choose this major because it combines two colleges that I am interested in, the college of engineering and the college of business. Hopefully with this major, I will be able to graduate with a good degree and return home and improve the business in my country.</p>
			<p>When I was back home I used to have a lot of hobbies and activates. Most of my hobbies were related to the water I used to sail, windsurf, swim, and row and many other watersports. I also used to play for one of the basketball clubs in my city and was an active member of the Libyan Boy Scouts since 2000 and joined the Red Crescent as a volunteer in 2011</p>
			<p>One of the main reasons that made me consider studying abroad was in 2011 the Libyan citizens rebelled against their dictator. It was a long revolution that lasted 8 months. During that time I volunteered in a lot of places and helped as much as I can. That revolution changed my life it gave me hope in my country that we can be a great country. After the revolution I was chosen with 6 other youths from Libya to go on a leadership exchange program in the US. This program helped me decide what I want to do in the future and that was get a good education in the US and return home to help improve my country.</p>
