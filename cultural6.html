			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>I anticipate that when parents take action towards the children the effect won't be that big because not all parents will actually do it. When the government considers the huge role video games and their effect on the youth. They will start taking actions towards it. When they do they will face a lot off problems because games like Call of Duty have a lot of the fans worldwide that will protest against the limitation off these games. These protests may lead to riots and bigger problems because some people may consider this as limiting their freedom of chose. 
</p>
			<p>If the governments were able to apply there laws on the companies, I think there will be major changes in all the communities worldwide. I think these will be behavior changes and social changes. Games may become more productive rather than ruining their lives, people won't be connected to their computers all day and start socializing with others.</p>
