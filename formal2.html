			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Many people think that electrical engineers are people that are always in there laboratories making experiments and building and designing new electrical equipment. I was one of the people that by becoming an engineer I would forget about writing and technique reports and would be focusing only on inventing a new electrical device that will change the world. So does it mean when someone become an electrical engineer he would only be in a lab trying to build some kind of electrical device.</p>
			<p>From the name itself electrical engineering is an engineering discipline that solves problems that involves and focuses on electrical and dynamic aspects. More specially, electrical engineering is primarily concerned on systems that depend on energy (electrical energy) to function. (Boker) Electrical engineering started in the early 17th century when European thinkers started to get attracted to the electrical phenomena. However electrical engineering was not considered a discipline till 1864 when a Scottish physicist summarized the laws of electricity in mathematical form, because like the present electrical engineering is still based on mathematical theories and predictions before laboratory demonstrations.( Ryder) Electrical engineers works on designing, developing, testing, and supervising the manufacturing of electrical equipment. Including power grids and generators, chips and circuits, system controls and more. (Donald) </p>
			<p>All the work electrical engineers would be wasted and useless if they donâ€™t know how to publish their finding with the wide scientific community. Electrical engineers are required to have a high level of writing and communication skills to report and advertise their designs as clearly and unambiguously as possible.  </p>
