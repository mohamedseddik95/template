			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Many people think that electrical engineers are people that are always in there laboratories making experiments and building and designing new electrical equipment. I was one of the people that by becoming an engineer I would forget about writing and technique reports and would be focusing only on inventing a new electrical device that will change the world. So does it mean when someone become an electrical engineer he would only be in a lab trying to build some kind of electrical device.</p>
		
			<p>All the work electrical engineers would be wasted and useless if they donâ€™t know how to publish their finding with the wide scientific community. Electrical engineers are required to have a high level of writing and communication skills to report and advertise their designs as clearly and unambiguously as possible.  </p>
			<h1>Methods</h1>
			<p>One of the main sources for this research was to conduct interview with experienced people who are or have been working or have conducted research within engineering disciplines.  The first person who I have interviewed graduate with a PhD degree specializing in control of dynamical systems from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Michigan State University, and just began a postdoctoral job that involves control of large scale systems.  His Name is AlMuatazbeelah Boker. Dr. Boker's research was related to the science of control systems engineering. This field of research can be applied in all branches of engineering. It is heavily used in the field of electrical engineering to influence the behavior of electrical systems so that they serve certain tasks set by the engineer/user. Dr. Boker was busy lately so I wasn't able to conduct a face to face interview with him, but he gladly responded to all my E-mails. I was able to gain a lot of information and knowledge from him.</p>
			<p>The other person I was able to interview was Hossam Ashtawy. Ashtawy graduated from Michigan State University with a master's degree in computer engineering, and currently, he is a doctoral student conducting a research on bioinformatics, which is an interdisciplinary field that uses computer science technology to solve biological problems. After conducting the research I sent them Emails making sure that I understood there point of view and some clarifications on some.</p>
			<p>The interview that I conducted will helped me as primary information for my report. Then, I started searching for my secondary information using google. I used some main point from the interview as keywords to help me find information and keep my sources connected together. I found using google scholar to find a scholar article about communication skills for the 21st century for engineering. After more awhile there weren't any helpful resource on google so I started searching using ProQuest. </p>
			<p>Using ProQuest was much useful it has more related information and I was able to find more sources for my report. After reading them, I summarized and highlighted the important information that will be useful for my report.</p>
