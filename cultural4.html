			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Call of Duty is just a game. So why do people go crazy about it? Well Call of Duty wasn’t that popular at first but with the improvement of graphic programmers and computer procures so computers can handle the size of the game to run it properly. Call of Duty became so real. When you see what programmers have done to improvement the game, you will feel that the characters in the game are so real, the environment around you is like you are actually there and the equipment you use are kind of equipment  most military forces around the world use. Don’t forget the story that you are playing is usually simulated from actual events that happened or are predicted to happen. All of these aspects made this game one of the best games in history. (Holmes)</p>
			<p>Video games were first introduces to the world in the late 1970s, but violent games started at the 1990 although around 20 years separated the start of video games and violent games  which was their main goal it to hurt, kill or wound something. Buyers were interested to play violent games rather than the other games. A research in 1996 showed that 59% of the girls and 69 % of the boys in the 4th grade favorite games were violent games. (Anderson)</p>
			<p>One issue most societies are suffering from is that a lot of people that play violent video games like Call of Duty for long periods of time; start to have a change of behavior. One of the problems that the games present is that to win you have to kill. In other words the players is the one killing and murdering in the games one way or another, plus the consequences of killing might change in players thought because while playing these games such as Call of Duty. To upgrade or to reach higher levels you need to kill more, instead of being punished for it. (*)</p>
			<p>From my personal experience, in 2011 my country Libya rebelled against its dictator during the Arab Spring. Before the revolution started I knew a lot of people who got addicted to Call of duty, and in Call of Duty when you die you can just start from the beginning with a push of a button. When the revolution started it was peaceful protests at first. Then it became a war between the Libyan citizens and the mercenaries of Libyan ex-leader. During this war unfortunately some people died because they thought they will just start all over like in the video game. That is caused by over playing video games that are so realistic that some people forgot the difference between real life and video games.</p>
			<p>Another international incident that happened in Norway. A man kills 66 people in a mass killing. He admitted that he trained on how to kill by playing Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. This shows that the effect this game has on people and how realistic the game became that normal people were able to learn how to you weapons. (McAllister)</p>
