			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Many other skills are essential to electrical engineering, rather than just the academic knowledge of the discipline. Furthermore, electrical engineering are expected to communicate with everyone the scientific community, clients and customers to be informed about the latest advances in the field the problems that the community faces. In this research, contributors were a Postdoctoral, AlMuatazbeelah Boker, and a PhD student, Hossam Ashtawy. The interview was conducted online via E-mail because of their busy schedule. Other resources were found by using the university resources like MSU libraries and ProQuest, also google scholar was a good place to find sources. All these came handy by summarizing them to help me plan my outline and drafts for the final paper.  Electrical Engineering is one of the main and important disciplines within any engineering college. This discipline mainly deals with designing and developing electrical devices that benefit your communities. Furthermore electrical engineers consider communication skills are something vital with their professional careers. Writing skills are one of the most important skills engineers and suppose to have because it is always connected to the inventions and finding of an engineer and that why many universities focus on writing in all its types (technical. Scientific, research proposal, lab reports, and email writing). With all these findings some were pretty expected of any electrical engineer, nevertheless, others were helpful and gave me a better insight of what I should be expecting about the communication and research in electrical engineering as I progress.</p>
