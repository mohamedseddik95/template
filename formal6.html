			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Another important aspect in all the engineering disciplines is research.  Dr. Boker said "There would be no science called 'electrical engineering' if there was no research". Also, the propose of engineering is to solve problems humans face. These problems change with time and place, so the engineering fields have continuously evolved to be able to solve these problems. This is where research becomes vital to provide tools and solutions to face these changing problems. (Boker)</p>
			<p>At Michigan State University, college of engineering research program is very important. Within the department of electrical engineering there are many professors working in many different and interesting projects such as communication and signal processing, integrated microsystems, and many more. One project which is really interesting and has the attention of many researchers is the biomedical. There are many projects that are being worked on made within the electrical engineering department regarding biomedical. The research made in the electrical department include "signal proceeding applied to cardiovascular, neural system, speech and brain signaling, micro-electro-mechanical systems applied to neural implants, biosensors, and long term implants, and ultrasonics and electromagnetics for therapy and medical imaging." (Research) All these research started because our society is facing a problem, and thatâ€™s where engineers research come in. (boker)</p>
