                         <h1> blog 1 </h1>
                                <p> The purpose of the  video was to show that as long as there's love between two individual no matter what their gender it is fine to have a relationship with one another. The achieved it purpose my explaining the story of an uncle with his nephew on how it affected him on his life. The message was sent as a video and a person explained his story and showed his emotions. It can help me in my assignment because it reflected something of his past that made him how he is now. </p>
                        <h1> blog 2 </h1>
                                <p> The video was targeting the people that play world of warcraft and specially the player that are addicted to the game and play it all the time. The social issues that the video is trying to show, is that some players get addicted to the game that they lose their social life and play 24 7. They creators of the video identified a lot of aspects of the issue like being indoors and not connecting with others, becoming lazy and fat, losing connection with your parents and arguing with them, living in the basement of your parentsâ€™ house and the idea of parents don't know anything about technology. </p>
                        <h1> blog 3</h1>
                                <p>While writing my first assignment it helped me remember the thing that i used to do during my child hood. That made me think more about the present like what am i doing and where am I going? While writing it helped me connect the past to the present and improve my brainstorming techniques and writing skills that will come handy in the future. At first I was going to drop the class because it was too complicating to use the Github and all that stuff but as an engineering I need to learn how to take a step back, take a break and start again and this is what a did with this course.</p>
                        <h1> blog 4</h1>        
                                <p>Starting assignment 3 which is the formal research paper, I started looking for my sources using the library resources. At first it was confusing and annoying. After hours of searching a I started to get the hang of it. Using the right keywords during the search helped me find some of the sources for my assignment. Now I will have to manage my sources and plan an outline for my paper and start writing.</p>
                        <h1>blog 5</h1>
                                <p>Last week I finished the basics of the code academy tutorial for making a webpage. During these tutorial I learnt the basics of coding like writing headlines paragraphs and format them by changing the color, size and font. All of this made me interested in program, although it's only the basics of programing but still it made me think more about my major.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 6</h1>
                                <p>The Ad very impressive and attracting. The pictures about Detroit started with the old and unfinished building to show the suffering of the city. Then with the background music of Eminem and the famous structures of Detroit shoed the true potential of the city. The over voice in the ad should the toughness and the long tiring periods the city went by. At the end it shows the achievement by producing the cars that are produced in America.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 7</h1>
                                <p>Using code academy to learn how to use HTML is really useful. Today I started the CSS, which made styling my HTML page user easy. Making changes to the whole page at once is much better that changing it one by one plus adding more codes. Using code academy also helped me think more about my major as engineering and what I might do in my future.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 8</h1>
                                <p>This week I am working with my group to make a documentary video about cell phones and there effects on the society. We will try to show the bad effects of cell phone with MSU campus and conduct interviews with student and see their point of view about it. My group is made of 4 students. I have done a couple of group projects in the past, and to be honest I think this project may be the hardest because I feel that we are not communicating that well with one another. Hopefully we will finish in time. </p>
                        <h1>Blog 9</h1>
                                <p>Working as a team in the remix project was tough because one of my teammates never showed up to help and the other was making excuses. so most of the work was divided on to people. At the end we were able to communicate and finish the project but for future project I it will be hard to work in a team like the one I was in.</p> 
                        <h1>blog 10</h1> 
                                <p>My group finally finished the remix, I like the final result but it could me better. My next assignment is the course retrospective project. I will be writing on how this class helped me and also I will be working on a group that will create a website to hold all of our papers for future incoming students.</p>
