                        <h1> blog 3</h1>
                        <p>While writing my first assignment it helped me remember the thing that i used to do during my child hood. That made me think more about the present like what am i doing and where am I going? While writing it helped me connect the past to the present and improve my brainstorming techniques and writing skills that will come handy in the future. At first I was going to drop the class because it was too complicating to use the Github and all that stuff but as an engineering I need to learn how to take a step back, take a break and start again and this is what a did with this course.</p>
                        <hi> blog 4</hi>        
                        <p>Starting assignment 3 which is the formal research paper, I started looking for my sources using the library resources. At first it was confusing and annoying. After hours of searching a I started to get the hang of it. Using the right keywords during the search helped me find some of the sources for my assignment. Now I will have to manage my sources and plan an outline for my paper and start writing.</p>
