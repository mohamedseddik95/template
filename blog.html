                         <h1> blog 1 </h1>
                                <p> The purpose of the  video was to show that as long as there's love between two individual no matter what their gender it is fine to have a relationship with one another. The achieved it purpose my explaining the story of an uncle with his nephew on how it affected him on his life. The message was sent as a video and a person explained his story and showed his emotions. It can help me in my assignment because it reflected something of his past that made him how he is now. </p>
                        <h1> blog 2 </h1>
                                <p> The video was targeting the people that play world of warcraft and specially the player that are addicted to the game and play it all the time. The social issues that the video is trying to show, is that some players get addicted to the game that they lose their social life and play 24 7. They creators of the video identified a lot of aspects of the issue like being indoors and not connecting with others, becoming lazy and fat, losing connection with your parents and arguing with them, living in the basement of your parentsâ€™ house and the idea of parents don't know anything about technology. </p>
                        <h1> blog 3</h1>
                                <p>While writing my first assignment it helped me remember the thing that i used to do during my child hood. That made me think more about the present like what am i doing and where am I going? While writing it helped me connect the past to the present and improve my brainstorming techniques and writing skills that will come handy in the future. At first I was going to drop the class because it was too complicating to use the Github and all that stuff but as an engineering I need to learn how to take a step back, take a break and start again and this is what a did with this course.</p>
                        <h1> blog 4</h1>        
                                <p>Starting assignment 3 which is the formal research paper, I started looking for my sources using the library resources. At first it was confusing and annoying. After hours of searching a I started to get the hang of it. Using the right keywords during the search helped me find some of the sources for my assignment. Now I will have to manage my sources and plan an outline for my paper and start writing.</p>
                        <h1>blog 5</h1>
                                <p>Last week I finished the basics of the code academy tutorial for making a webpage. During these tutorial I learnt the basics of coding like writing headlines paragraphs and format them by changing the color, size and font. All of this made me interested in program, although it's only the basics of programing but still it made me think more about my major.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 6</h1>
                                <p>The Ad very impressive and attracting. The pictures about Detroit started with the old and unfinished building to show the suffering of the city. Then with the background music of Eminem and the famous structures of Detroit shoed the true potential of the city. The over voice in the ad should the toughness and the long tiring periods the city went by. At the end it shows the achievement by producing the cars that are produced in America.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 7</h1>
                                <p>After finishing the basics of HTML like making paragraphs changing the font and making the structure of a website. Now the tricky and helpful part starts the CSS. The CSS allows you to style the website in a much easier and faster way. Instead of changing every page and every sentence you can link it to the CSS styling page and code everything there and apply the changes to all the pages at once. The CSS will help me while redesigning my portfolio and during the last assignment when the class does his own website.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 8</h1>
                                <p>This week I am working with my group to make a documentary video about cell phones and there effects on the society. We will try to show the bad effects of cell phone with MSU campus and conduct interviews with student and see their point of view about it. My group is made of 4 students. I have done a couple of group projects in the past, and to be honest I think this project may be the hardest because I feel that we are not communicating that well with one another. Hopefully we will finish in time. </p>
                        <h1>Blog 9</h1>
                                <p>During my life I worked in different group project with people that I never meet from all around the world, and I never had major problems communicating with them. During the Remix some teammates we not taking the class seriously and didn't help in making the remix succeed. Projects like the remix need a team that knows how to communicate and help one another. This assignment helped me understand that without communication and good time management projects can become a disaster. I will remember this class and this experience whenever I start any group project in the future.</p> 
                        <h1>blog 10</h1> 
                                <p>My group finally finished the remix, I like the final result but it could me better. My next assignment is the course retrospective project. I will be writing on how this class helped me and also I will be working on a group that will create a website to hold all of our papers for future incoming students.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 11</h1>
                                <p>Three more weeks to the end semester and I have started to write my final paper. While brain storming for this paper I started to see how this class has improved many of my skills. The first assignment how to write a narrative. the second helped me analysis an object and see how it effects other things. the Third was conducting research and making interviews. the forth, working in teams and being creative on how to present my work. All these assignments improved a skill which will help me during my college years and beyond. </p>
                        <h1>Blog 12</h1>
                                <p>Two more weeks to finals, I finished the first draft for my final paper and started to work on the second part of the final assignment. The second part is as a class we will construct a website that contains all our paper and how they benefited us. I part in this project is the web design team. I meet my teammates, they seem alright and hopefully we will be able to finish the coding of the website in time. During the last class of the year we were able to make the outer skeleton of the website. The main issue will be the design of the webpage and how creative will it be. Another issue is that not all of the teammates are well in coding and we are getting closer and closer to finals week and it's getting harder to make time for other stuff to fit in our schedule. Hopefully we will push our self to the limit and finish it in time. </p>
                        <h1>Blog 13</h1>
                                <p>Half way done with my first part of my final project the course retrospective. Meanwhile for part two I met with two of my teammate in the library to start the styling for the web page. First we placed a plan to follow and the things we expect to have in the website in their words we did an outline. After that we started experimenting things on our own portfolios and then implementing them to the website. We learned new tricks like placing an image as a background then placing a transparent background over it so the words can show and many other tricks that helped us design the website. In general I am happy with the work we have done today and our final design for the website. We are waiting for the other groups to send the content for the website to send it via D2l.</p>
