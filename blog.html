                        <h1> blog 3</h1>
                        <p>While writing my first assignment it helped me remember the thing that i used to do during my child hood. That made me think more about the present like what am i doing and where am I going? While writing it helped me connect the past to the present and improve my brainstorming techniques and writing skills that will come handy in the future. At first I was going to drop the class because it was too complicating to use the Github and all that stuff but as an engineering I need to learn how to take a step back, take a break and start again and this is what a did with this course.</p>
                        <h1> blog 4</h1>        
                        <p>Starting assignment 3 which is the formal research paper, I started looking for my sources using the library resources. At first it was confusing and annoying. After hours of searching a I started to get the hang of it. Using the right keywords during the search helped me find some of the sources for my assignment. Now I will have to manage my sources and plan an outline for my paper and start writing.</p>
                        <h1>blog 5</h1>
                        <p>Last week I finished the basics of the code academy tutorial for making a webpage. During these tutorial I learnt the basics of coding like writing headlines paragraphs and format them by changing the color, size and font. All of this made me interested in program, although it's only the basics of programing but still it made me think more about my major.</p>
                        <h1>Blog 6</h1>
                        <p>The Ad very impressive and attracting. The pictures about Detroit started with the old and unfinished building to show the suffering of the city. Then with the background music of Eminem and the famous structures of Detroit shoed the true potential of the city. The over voice in the ad should the toughness and the long tiring periods the city went by. At the end it shows the achievement by producing the cars that are produced in America.</p>
