		<h1>lived experiences </h1>
		<p>Since childhood I had the passion to become an engineer. That passion grew within me by the support of my family, that’s because for the last three generations my family has been bring up some of the best engineering in my country. While growing up I saw and experienced different types of engineering. My father was a civil engineer and runs his own construction company, my brother is electrical, a couple of my cousins where petroleum engineers and so on. So I had the chance to see and try the different types of engineering. </p>
		<p>During my childhood I always fancied electronic devises and specially robots. One of my favorite cartoons when I was young was about a super cyborg that saves the planet. So while growing up I was always fascinated on what computer devises are made and how they work. Also what made me so interested in computers were the things a computer can do a normal human will take a while to do and process, like solving long problem and equations. Another thing that made me more connected to the computer is how its built. That all the different parts of a computer like the monitor and the hard drives are all connected to one circuit board, and that's kind of similar to the human body parts are connected to the brain, and the coding or software of a computer that makes it function tries to act as the nervous system of the human body.</p>
		<p>One experience made me connect more to electrical engineering is when one of my toys stop working. I always tried to take it apart and see if there is a problem that I could fix. My brother which is an electrical engineer would always come and help me out and explains the different parts of the circuit to try to find the problem. One day he brought home a kit which you can use the tools in it to make a small device that runs with solar power. The pieces provided are simple so anyone can use it and it allows you to build anything, the only limit of your creation was your imagination.</p>
		<p>Another thing made me lean more towards electrical engineering was during my senior year in high school, where I took a circuit class. During this class my passion towards electrical engineering grew. My professor used to take us to her lab in the university to show use some of the projects she is working on and one of them was about robotics, which was basically a cartoon show until I when to her lab and saw her equipment's. She also brought to class a small device to class everyday so we can explore and see how electricity and electronics work. So what is electrical engineering? It's the science that studies the uses of electricity and the equipment for power generation and distribution and the control of machines and communication. So basically I would be designing and developing electric equipment to perform a certain duty.</p>
		<p>At the end of my high school year the Arab Spring reached my country Libya. Where we rebelled against the dictator that was ruling the country. I had to take a gap year because I missed the deadline for applying for colleges in the US, which didn’t end up to be that bad because I learnt a lot of knowledge and experience that year. During that time I participated in a couple of leadership and management programs around the world, where I felt something towards beginning a leader of something. I also had a kind of internship working in my father's company. I started working in the main office where I helped in basic paperwork and getting coffee, but I was never the type of person that stays indoors doing paperwork the whole day. After I while I moved to work on a concert mixing plant where I basically worked under the manager of the plant. Where I learnt that there is a management side of engineering. So I was able to move around on the site interact with people while doing the paperwork, I also had fun where I drove some of the heavy equipment on the site. During that time I learnt the basic management skills on how to operate a site and the methods in working with people with different background and professions. After getting accepted in MSU I heard about Applied Engineering Science. </p>
		<p>Applied Engineering Science (AES) is considered a new major it mainly combines between two colleges, college of engineering, and the college of business. It prepares technically competent, broad-based engineering graduates who have acquired a systems perspective for problem-solving and business expertise. The program provides a broad foundation in science and mathematics, engineering, and business management and is designed to develop graduates who can apply the rigor of their technical education to diverse problems and settings. The program is structured to establish skills in areas such as effective management, contemporary technical issues, deployment of new technologies, resolving ethical dilemmas, effective communication across technical disciplines both in oral and written communication, and lifelong learning. Pursuing a major like Applied Engineering science it will allow me to combine my passion to become an engineer by learning the problem solving and basic technical mentality of an engineer, and my new interest which is the more managing and business part of engineering.</p>
		<p>During my first semester at MSU and learning more about both majors started to wonder about my which academic path should I follow and consider AES which is a kind of a new major and might affect me when I go home because it is not that known within the US and as an international student that is intending to go back home it will be much harder to explain it, plus the name doesn’t really indicate much about the major, and that means I have to put more effort explaining and clarifying the things I will be capable to do after graduation, but  I will start directly with the management side of engineering which I'm currently attracted to, or should I follow my passion in electrical engineer which will be following the safe side and then get a higher degree in engineering management after getting experience in my professional career, which will take more than a couple of years to accomplish.</p>
		<p>So a simple cartoon show, a little support of family and a little of exploring during my childhood made me choose my major as an engineer. The exploration of computes and growing up to help my father at work made me so confused between my childhood passion which is electrical engineering and my new interest in applied engineering science to become a leader and a manager. For both majors I still have a long way to go, but one will be harder and more interesting than the other specially during my professional career.</p>
