	<h1> Remix Project Assessment MEMO </h1>
		<h2> Composing in Context</h2>
			<p> Our video was based on smart phones issues in our society,  because this issue is one of the most recent issue our community is facing, it didn’t affect us a lot while searching and composing the facts for our project. Search thought the internet and reading the paper one of my teammates has written. I had a better understanding and more knowledge about cell phones and there effects on our  social. Although cell  phones is a common issue now a days and there are a lot of sources we looked into, but picking the right information and organizing in the documentary  was the major issue we faced.  Knowing the audience helped use prepare better because we know who they are and how to relate to them.</p>
		<h2> Process </h2>
			<p>We started by reading each other's papers. Then we discussed which will be the best paper to remix into a documentary. At the end we had to choose between video games and there effect on society, or cell phones and there effects. We finally agreed on making a documentary about cell phones and there effects on the society.</p>
			<p>During the process of making the video from interviews and collecting data to combining everything in one video, communicating as a team was the hardest thing I faced. I a problem communicating with the team because some of my teammates weren’t taking the project seriously and didn’t help the rest of the team finishing the video. That made me uncomfortable working in the group.</p>
		<h2>Research </h2>
			<p>Most of the resources we used are from Elise's paper which played a major source of recourse for our video. We also used the internet to finds statistics and facts to support our claim as secondary sources.   </p>
		<h2>Collaboration</h2>
			<p>Our group is made of four students the project was made only by three. Chunyong Lou unfortunately  did nothing he only helped in the proposal then never showed up for anything else the interviews nor helping in editing the video. As for the rest of the team they all participated is equal share of work. Working in a group in a project like this is really good and really helpful because it's not an easy task to do alone, but when you work with a group that doesn't communicate well and has trouble with one another may cause a huge disaster and no one will learn anything from the project.</p>
		<h2>Project management</h2>
			<p>After writing the proposal we sat together and discussed in details what we expect our video will be like. After that we divided the group into two. Elsie and I we made the interviews and gathered most of the facts mean while Rohit was responsible to edit and make the video. The issue we face in managing time was making deadlines. Whenever we agreed o a date in the last minute someone comes up with a excuse not to come and that made the project harder to finish with a high quality in time. If I had the chance to do this project again I would manage time better rather than just dividing the work.</p>
		<h2>Documentary Design </h2>
			<p>I think the most effective aspect in your documentary is our facts that we showed and the interviews made. The facts are interesting because it shows how people are connected to their phones and for the interviews it is a way to relate to the audience because the interviewers were students like them. We agreed on the outline of the video and then the designer put his creative touch to make it more interesting. </p>
