			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>One issue most societies are suffering from in the behavior of their young. Though the last ten years the gaming industry has developed and improved to provide there consumers with the best games. With this improvement the quality and graphic of games have become so clear that a player might not see the difference. With this improvement problems within the society started to emerge. Games such as Call of Duty started to have effects on players. People that play video games for hours every day have been noticed to have behavior changes, they have become more aggressive and violent, and that related to the games they play, because these games made killing and wounding other so simple and easy and without consequences that it affected the players personally.  A lot of local and international incidence started to appear and one way or another they are connected to these violent games. I personally think there are many ways to solve the issue but it won't be easy with the amount of supporters these games have. </p>
